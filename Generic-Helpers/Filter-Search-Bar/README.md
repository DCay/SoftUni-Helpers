# Filter Search Bar

## This is a simple functionality of a search bar with filter which displays pre-loaded results.

* Each element has an image and a caption with it.
* If the search bar has an empty string, no elements will be shown.
* The search is case-insensitive.

## Some disclaimers

* The style is quite static, meaning - if you are using this helper, you might need to modify the style to match your case.
* The functionality is vanilla JS - if you are using some framework, check first if you don't already have something like this built-in, or with a plugin.
